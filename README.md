# Author Bio

- **When I was 13**, my only wish was to have my own MMORPG.
- This is when I picked up my first programming book, [Symfonia C++](https://www.ifj.edu.pl/private/grebosz/symfonia_c++_std_p.html) by Jerzy Grƒôbosz.
- I'm completely self-taught, though I did enroll at the [top3 high school in the country (at the time)](https://www.v-lo.krakow.pl/).
- I began writing *Hypersomnia* once I turned 18. I'm now 28.
- At 19 I **went to work** as a junior C++ programmer instead of going for a higher education.
- I later went on multiple year-long breaks from work to focus on writing *Hypersomnia*, whilst living from my savings.
- Thanks to my experience with *Hypersomnia*, I had an opportunity to work on [POBG](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSP5P0QGWa4) as the main gameplay programmer. It was an April Fool's event game for *PUBG: Battlegrounds*.  
- Since 2020, I became passionate about investing, thanks to which my savings lasted way longer than they'd otherwise.
- My financial decisions now let me focus 100% on *Hypersomnia*.
- I use Arch Linux, and I wrote *Hypersomnia* in NeoVim, *without* autocomplete (but with 21 other plugins - [vim-easymotion](https://github.com/easymotion/vim-easymotion) being my favourite).
